Source code for my Youtube AngularJS 1.x course
Welcome!
This repository contains source code for my Youtube course on AngularJS 1.x. In order to fully benefit from the course, I assume that you have the following software installed:-
1)Visual Studio Code
2)Latest versions of IE / Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Safari. I just use IE and Chrome.

If you have any questions, you can drop me an email at virnay1@yahoo.com
