Source code for my Youtube AngularJS 1.x course
Welcome!
This repository contains source code for my Youtube course on AngularJS 1.x.
You can go to https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=aIZHWfLMkhs to start watching it.
In order to fully benefit from the course, I assume that you have the following software installed:-
1)Visual Studio Code
2)Latest versions of IE / Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Safari. I just use IE and Chrome.

I also assume that you have some prior knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I will be coming up with courses for these in the next few weeks too. You can subscribe to my channel to see the latest updates.

If you have any questions, you can drop me an email at virnay1@yahoo.com
